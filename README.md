I'm a data enthusiast and aspiring plant dad who enjoys growing succulents, herbs, and robust data infrastructure. I'm also a UC Berkeley **Data Science** alum. Go bears! 🐻

I’m currently a **Jr. Data Engineer** at TickPick, where I help make affordable and transparent ticket pricing possible for everyone’s favorite live events. Previously, I built pipelines and data products for real estate and retail competitive analysis at [Dotlas](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dotlas/).
